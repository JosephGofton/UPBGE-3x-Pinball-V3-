Keyboard instruction will appear & the rest is all down to the user.

VP forum holds four more tables that I have worked on: PacMan, TexasPoker, Invader & Skittles which may appeal to you. 
It is a visual basic coded-driven pinball game. It's all freeware for non-profit use only. 
You may also find them with AtGames if they are still being used by them.
